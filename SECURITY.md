# Security Policy for BrowserGuard

## Supported Versions

BrowserGuard is a rapidly evolving project. Due to the nature of userscripts and their reliance on browser environments, security updates are always targeted at the *latest* version. There are no actively maintained "older" versions.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | :white_check_mark: |

**Important:** It is *highly* recommended that you always use the most recent version of BrowserGuard to ensure you have the latest security fixes and threat definitions. Automatic updates (via Tampermonkey) are encouraged.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of BrowserGuard is paramount. We appreciate your help in responsibly disclosing any security vulnerabilities you may discover.

**Reporting Process:**

1.  **Do NOT create a public issue on GitHub:** Publicly disclosing a vulnerability before it has been addressed could put users at risk.
2.  **Contact the Maintainer Privately:** Send a detailed email to [jmhbm@dnmx.su] with the subject "BrowserGuard Security Vulnerability Report". Include the following information:
    *   A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
    *   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
    *   The version of BrowserGuard affected.
    *   Any potential impact of the vulnerability.
    *   Your contact information (so we can reach you for clarification).
3.  **Expectations:**
    *   We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **2 business days**.
    *   We will investigate the vulnerability and provide an update on our progress within **7 business days**.
    *   If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work to develop and release a fix as quickly as possible, prioritizing critical issues.
    *   We aim to release a fix within **14 business days** of confirming the vulnerability (though this may vary depending on the complexity of the issue).

**Vulnerability Acceptance/Declination:**

*   If the reported issue is a valid security vulnerability:
    *   We will credit you (if you wish) in the release notes for the fix.
    *   We will work with you (if needed) to understand the vulnerability and its impact.
*   If the reported issue is not a security vulnerability (e.g., a bug, a feature request, or a known limitation):
    *   We will explain why it is not considered a security vulnerability.
    *   We may create a public issue on GitHub to track the problem (if appropriate).

**Responsible Disclosure:**

We kindly request that you refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until a fix has been released and users have had an opportunity to update. This helps to protect the BrowserGuard community from potential harm.

Thank you for helping us keep BrowserGuard secure!
